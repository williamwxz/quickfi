      question: "What types of insurance policies can be tokenized?",
      answer: "QuickFi currently supports whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and certain types of term life insurance policies with cash value. We're expanding to support more policy types in the future."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I borrow against my policy?",
      answer: "Typically, you can borrow up to 75% of your policy's cash surrender value, depending on the policy type and issuer. Our system will calculate the exact amount available once your policy is verified."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my insurance policy still valid after tokenization?",
      answer: "Yes, your insurance policy remains fully valid and active. Tokenization doesn't affect the terms of your insurance policy or coverageâ€”it simply creates a digital representation that can be used as collateral."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I don't repay my loan?",
      answer: "If you don't repay your loan by the end of the term, part of your NFT value equivalent to your outstanding balance plus fees may be liquidated. However, your underlying insurance policy remains intact and valid."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the verification process take?",
      answer: "The verification process typically takes 24-48 hours, depending on how quickly we can verify your policy details with the insurance provider."
    },
    {
      question: "What blockchain does QuickFi use?",
      answer: "QuickFi operates on the Pharos blockchain, which offers high security, low transaction costs, and excellent scalability for our decentralized lending platform."
